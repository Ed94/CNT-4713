`client.py`, `server-s.py`, and  `server.py` are the entry points for the client, simplified server, and server parts of the project.


## Notes

Went well. Pretty rusty with python since I don't really use it anymore. Review videos provided by professor were good. 


## Problems

Understanding if server.py was required for this setup... (It was not specified in the project outline).

How much socket.settimeout did for me vs what I had to do was not clear.
